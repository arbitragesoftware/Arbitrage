## What is Arbitrage?
Arbitrage is to obtain risk-free profit by selling at the same time low price market and selling in high price market in case the same securities which are traded in different markets are different in price of money or precious metal. These products can be securities such as gold or precious metals or stocks. The aim here is to make a profit without risk. One of the most asked questions in our day is Arbitrage, that is, how to make a profit without risk? " Many large and globally recognized companies are looking for answers to this question by creating arbitrage pricing models. However, in today's capital markets and currency markets, it is more difficult than it is supposed. Because now almost all the markets are intertwined and information sharing has reached incredible speeds. In this respect, it has become increasingly difficult to manually capture the wrong prices in any market and to make profits by arbitraging in this market. As such, arbitrage operations have become possible with algorithmic software. These software make arbitrary arbitrage transactions by sending orders to both stocks at the same time when arbitrage opportunities for the same securities traded in different markets are created.

## Arbitrage Examples

Although it is difficult to arbitrage with human power in today's market conditions as we have mentioned above, it is possible to theoretically arbitrage at times when volatility increases. For example, Euro TL - Dollar TL gives us the Euro Dollar price. While it is almost impossible to arbitrage on the price of Euro Dollar, it may be possible to make it possible by putting TL into the business and theoretically arbitrage.

It is also possible to arrest arbitrage on the gold order. Gold is the right financial tool for arbitrage trading on virtually every local stock exchange. The price of gold is traded in dollars at international markets. However, gold is traded in local currencies at local stock exchanges. For example; Grams per contract in the Futures and Options Exchange Market under the roof of Istanbul in Turkey operation, it is to see. In India, gold contracts are traded in the Indian Rupee (INR). Arbitrage opportunity between two stock exchanges can be obtained by turning the same product traded in local currency on both stock exchanges.

The most important thing to remember about the arbitrage operation is that we have to sell the same product at the same place while we are taking it from one place. Because basically, arbitrage aims to provide advantage from price differences.

Bitcoin arbitrage is the buying of bitcoins on an exchange where the price is very low and selling it at an exchange where the price is relatively higher. The prices of Bitcoin vary on various exchanges, due to the fact that the markets are not directly linked, and the trading volume,&nbsp;on many exchanges, is low enough that the price does not adjust to the average right away.

From Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunities: Is it Really Profitable?


# What is an Arbitrage?

An arbitrage is literally the simultaneous buying and selling of an asset (token or coin in the crypto world) at the exact same time on two different exchanges. The price difference between how much you buy and sell for is the profit yielded. For example, if bitcoin (BTC) was being traded on Coinbase for $10,000, but it was being traded on Binance for $9,500. It would make sense to buy BTC on Binance and sell it on Coinbase. Each transaction for one entire BTC would yield $500. $500 on a $10,000 investment is a five percent return. A five percent daily return is astronomical over the long run. However, in the crypto world five percent arbitrages existed all over the place because exchanges are decentralized.

When you send a buy/sell order into any of the broker websites for stocks it gets paired against all other purchase orders on other exchanges. You are not solely trading amongst the individuals on that specific platform. For crypto, this is the opposite. If you place a buy order on site A, but on site B someone is willing to sell for the price you stated, the buy order and sell order will not align and automatically fill. Someone on your specific site has to wish to buy or sell at your stated price for the order to go through. This can result in large arbitrages between different marketplaces.

The crypto space for a long time has been known for these large percentage arbitrages between different exchanges. When demand is higher in one part of the world, or their fiat currency is stronger, the coin being purchased or sold in that region can lead to a significant percentage gain using trading arbitrage. South Korea, until January 31, was known for having some of the best arbitrage pricing around.
South Korea and Arbitrage Trading

The fastest decline in crypto prices have taken place in South Korea. Which is actually fairly surprising as they are finally allowed to begin trading as of January 31. However, this is likely the dip that occurs prior to all major bull rallies, finalizing our bear raid for the prior month. With prices in South Korea for BTC and other cryptocurrencies falling at a rate even greater than when compared to international markets. Bitcoin used to trade at a 51 percent premium on Korean exchanges. However, the most recent crash has sent prices of BTC along with altcoins back in line with those of international markets across the world. This was the first time prices have been similar across the different world markets for BTC. South Koreans have grown accustomed to paying a premium for BTC.

The South Koreans have a nickname for this Premium they pay on BTC, the “Kimchi Premium.” Having such a high Premium and arbitrage opportunity was not only dumbfounding but also enticing to the South Korean people. So much so that they named this “Premium” after their staple dish, Kimchi. This clearly demonstrates the change in investor sentiment in what had previously been one of the worlds most exciting markets for crypto. This is another reason why many of the Korean-oriented coins have also taken an unfortunate beating. However, the King is confident the grass is greener on the other side. The King’s follow-up article will highlight why February has many positive changes in store for the entire crypto market and a nice rebound!

## Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunities: A Short Guide


Bitcoin arbitrage is the buying of bitcoins on an exchange where the price is very low and selling it at an exchange where the price is relatively higher. The prices of Bitcoin vary on various exchanges, due to the fact that the markets are not directly linked, and the trading volume, on many exchanges, is low enough that the price does not adjust to the average right away.

Here a great video by Andreas Antonopoulos about why these arbitrage opportunities even exist:

A Simplified Example of a Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunity
The price of Bitcoin on Coinbase is $650 and the price of Bitcoin on BTC-E is $636, the difference between the prices is $14, and this is quite a decent opportunity for arbitraging. Lets say, you buy 100 bitcoins on BTC-E at the rate of $636 each and subsequently, you sell them at Coinbase at the rate of $650 each, you make $14 per Bitcoin. Lets get down to the math

Number of Bitcoins bought in BTC-E = 100

Price of each Bitcoin = $636

Total price  = $636 * 100 = $63,600

Number of Bitcoins sold in Coinbase = 100

Price of each Bitcoin = $650

Total  = $650 * 100 = $65,000

Total profit = $65,000 – $63,600= $1,400

Thus, you can see that Bitcoin arbitrage seems like a wonderful opportunity to make some passive income, but there are a few barriers to it.

### Barriers to Bitcoin Arbitrage

The time it takes to verify each of the transactions (buying and selling) can add up and the exchange rate might change within that timeframe.
Many exchanges require a lot of verifications in order to trade a large number of Bitcoins.
Depositing fiat currency can be a time taking process (can take up to 10 days depending on your payment method).
Many exchanges have fees, which I have overlooked in the given example, that you should take into account.
Pay attention to the transaction volume on each exchange as you may end up not being able to sell all of the Bitcoin you bought at the cheaper exchange.
Price differences also reflect an exchange’s reputation. For example, BTC-E’s exchange rate is lower these days because less people are trusting the exchange to handle their money correctly. Less trust = less buyers = lower exchange rate. The same thing happened during the last days of Mt.Gox where the price was lower and lower because people didn’t trust the exchange to allow them to withdraw their money.
A Detailed Bitcoin Arbitrage Calculator
So now let’s take the real live example (not a simplified one) and actually include all of the different fees that are involved in such an arbitrage. Those fees include:

Fiat deposit fees
Fiat withdrawal fees
Bitcoin deposit fees
Bitcoin withdrawal fees
Transaction fees

I’ve taken the liberty to create some sort of calculator using Google spreadsheets just to show you how hard it can be to actually create a profit. Take a look below:

If you want to clone this calculator yourself feel free to download it at this link. All of this suggests that Bitcoin arbitrage is quite a difficult task. If you play around with the numbers a bit you’ll see that if the spread (difference between buy and sell values) grows a bit larger you start to become profitable. But in the current state we are actually losing money in the process.

However, if you look even further into the calculator’s data you’ll see that BTC-E takes up to 10 days to receive your deposit. In that time the spread can change. So the best tactic would be to keep some fiat currency in the exchange before hand and choose the right time to execute the arbitrage.

### Should I Try to Arbitrage Bitcoin?
If you have some extra BTC, or cash, then you’re welcome to try it yourself.  As long as you are careful, and set strict guidelines for when, and how, you will engage in this process.  Unlike speculation, margin trading, and other activities that can be viewed as market manipulation, and in some cases, may even be truly harmful to the market as a whole, arbitrage is a positive process.

Bitcoins should not cost varying amounts across each exchange, especially consider that all of the exchanges can be accessed from one’s computer.  Arbitrage simply brings the exchanges together to an average price.  As Bitcoin’s market grows, the gap between exchanges will narrow, as the rate at which people arbitrage increases.  The current volume can certainly help an individual make a significant amount of cash, but it is not yet worthwhile for large financial firms to engage in Bitcoin arbitrage directly.

Overall, Bitcoin arbitrage may be an opportunity to make some passive income but at the same time, it has risks. Moreover, almost all exchanges have an API and these can prove to be very prosperous for you. Utilizing these APIs will give you the tools you need to create a custom arbitrage bot, or hire someone to do it for you.  Still, even attempting to arbitrage manually can be very beneficial, as long as you watch closely, and make sure you are placing simultaneous trades.

My personal opinion is that if you want to make some real profit from arbitraging you have to become an arbitrage professional. You probably won’t be able to arbitrage successful on your first or second try. Like everything else it takes practice, patience and experience. If you’ve had any experience with Bitcoin arbitrage I’d love to hear it in the comment section below.

It’s the kind of market anomaly that savvy traders usually devour in fractions of a second: bitcoin prices in South Korea are 43 percent higher than those in the U.S.

Arbitrage 101 says buy in America, sell in Korea, and pocket the difference for a risk-free profit, minus transaction costs.

If only it were that easy.

Market participants who’ve studied the price gap, known locally as the “kimchi premium,” say Korea’s foreign-exchange and anti-money-laundering rules are making it difficult for traders to gobble up the proverbial free lunch.


The lack of selling pressure from arbitragers has left bitcoin prices in Korea tethered to the whims of the nation’s individual investors. The resulting boom has alarmed local authorities and underscored how fractured markets and feverish speculation can lead to strange outcomes in the nascent world of cryptocurrencies.

It also helps explain why Coinmarketcap.com, a widely followed provider of data on digital currencies, excluded Korean exchanges from some of its pricing calculations this week.

The move, which created the appearance of a market selloff for the website’s users, helped spark a real-life exodus from several digital currencies on Monday. Bitcoin sank more than 10 percent, according to composite pricing on Bloomberg. It retreated another 2.6 percent on Tuesday.

Despite the turbulence, bitcoin’s Korea premium shows few signs of disappearing. Below are some of the biggest reasons why the gap has persisted, along with a few ideas on how arbitragers can still make money.
Strong Local Demand

Koreans have an outsized infatuation with bitcoin. The country punches above its weight when it comes to cryptocurrency volumes, with local venue Bithumb ranked No. 2 worldwide by Coinmarketcap.com. So many Koreans have piled in that the prime minister recently warned that bitcoin might corrupt the country’s youth.

There’s no definitive explanation for why the fervor is so extreme, but some observers point to the long-held fondness for supercharged financial bets in a country that once boasted the world’s most active stock-index derivatives market.

It helps that local cryptocurrency exchanges don’t allow short sales, making it difficult for bears to bet against the market. (The government also proposed banning non-residents from cryptocurrency venues in December.)

While policy makers have vowed to crack down on excessive speculation, that may just be adding fuel to the frenzy in the short term, said Mike Kayamori, head of Tokyo-based exchange Quoine, which counts Koreans among its customers.

“Before regulation kicks in, people want to buy,” he said.

Korea’s Forex Rules

To arbitrage the price gaps between bitcoin venues in Korea and elsewhere, local traders must first exchange their won into a foreign currency, such as the dollar or euro, that’s accepted by overseas cryptocurrency venues.

Korea’s foreign-exchange regulations put a wrench in the process. Local residents and companies moving more than $50,000 out of the country in a single year must submit documents to authorities proving their reasons for the transfers, which may not always be approved. Annual transactions totaling more than $10,000 must be reported to tax authorities.

“The won is a restricted currency, so cannot be easily exchanged,” said Cedric Jeanson, chief executive officer of BitSpread Group, which has offices in New York, London and Singapore.

Some traders are concerned that foreign exchange purchases related to cryptocurrency arbitrage could trigger anti-money-laundering inquiries.

“If you attempt to move out of positions in Korea, they have tougher money-laundering tools,” said Tony Pietrocola, head of business development at financial technology company PromonTech. “To fill out the paperwork and do those transactions, you could easily get flagged.”

Representatives from Korea’s finance ministry and central bank declined to comment.

It’s worth noting that Korea isn’t the only country where bitcoin trades at a premium, even if it is the standout among major markets. Other nations with a history of capital controls, including Zimbabwe and Argentina, also have big price gaps versus the U.S.
Volatility Risk

Another hurdle in Korea -- and elsewhere -- is that transferring bitcoin between exchanges isn’t always instantaneous. That can leave arbitragers exposed to adverse price swings.

“Making a quick transaction with low risk is just not there for this space,” said Ian Rosen, CEO of financial communications platform Stocktwits. “There’s difficulty moving money in and out of exchanges.”

Professional arbitragers with experience in managing such volatility may be reluctant to operate on bitcoin exchanges because many of the venues are unregulated and vulnerable to hacking.
Potential Workarounds?

Moonsung Bae, a 36-year-old financial analyst in Seoul who trades cryptocurrencies for his personal account, said he has profited from the kimchi premium without transferring funds into foreign currencies. Instead, he uses alternative cryptocurrencies like ether.

One of his strategies involves buying ether in Korea, transferring it to an offshore venue, exchanging it for bitcoin, transferring the bitcoin back to Korea, and cashing out. That works as long as Korea’s ether premium is smaller than the bitcoin premium, he said.

For more on cryptocurrencies, check out the Decrypted podcast:

Another option is arbitraging price differences between Korean exchanges, Bae said. On Tuesday, bitcoin traded at the equivalent of $21,751 on Bithumb, versus $22,674 on another Korean venue called Upbit. That compared with $15,255 on Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. exchanges.

Well, how did the arbitrage opportunity evaporate? BTC has dropped more than 60 percent on the Korean exchanges after the nation’s regulations took several steps over the prior two months to regulate trading in the country. What was originally thought to be a ban turned out to be positive legislation allowing traders to deposit $20,000 weekly, while having to use their real names for trading accounts. This type of legislation should be praised and expected. This was not how the market reacted. The Kimchi Premium began shrinking rapidly since January 12 when the FUD attacks came full force out of South Korea. Now that legislation has been enacted the greater issue is the $20,000 amounts impede individuals looking to move large amounts of crypto due to the country’s anti-money laundering laws.

On February 1, bitcoin was trading at approximately $8,450 in South Korea while it was being traded for $8,605 on GDAX/Coinbase. Although there is a minor price difference, it is minuscule when investors consider that the Kimchi Premium had led to five to 35 percent price differences depending on which market you purchased BTC on. At the beginning of January when the Kimchi Premium truly peaked there was a $7,500 difference between the price of BTC in South Korea and the international average. To put this into perspective if you purchased one bitcoin and had a South Korean trading account, you could transfer yourself that same BTC, and it would be worth almost $7,500 more based on the value of the South Korean Won and their rate against the BTC. You would have to have access to a South Korean trading account, but for a 30 percent arbitrage opportunity, one could easily make friends with an individual in South Korea to do this with all day and make 15 percent each! Unfortunately, this opportunity no longer exists.
The Arbitrage Opportunity is Temporarily Gone

Arbitrage exists where there is the most turmoil. South Korea is no longer having turmoil regarding their exchanges, so the arbitrage opportunity disappeared. When South Korea was worried about banning crypto entirely the highest Kimchi Premium existed. This was not coincidental. When Zimbabwe had a major uprising in 2017 the price of bitcoin was 50 percent higher on local exchanges and within the country than on international markets. When individuals stop trusting their governments the value of cryptocurrency skyrockets. Currently, the populations of the world have faith in governments that if they were people, would not be given loans at a bank. Yet, because they are governments in trillions of dollars in debt, other governments and banks continue to provide liquidity.

The King believes fiat is no more trustworthy than cryptocurrencies (the ones that are not scams) because there no longer is any true value backing the dollars, yen, won, or pesos of the world. The arbitrage play had been a hidden gem for big investors with multiple BTC on many foreign exchanges, and unfortunately for them, it has evaporated. However, the world is full of turmoil and whether the Kimchi Premium arises again, the Hamburger Fee (U.S.), or the Samosa Tax (India) the world has not seen the end of arbitrage investing. The positive news is the turmoil has subsided in South Korea; the negative news is it took a great arbitrage opportunity with it.
